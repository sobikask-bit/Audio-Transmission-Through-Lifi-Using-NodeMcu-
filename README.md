**ABSTRACT **
In today's interconnected world, the proliferation of wireless devices accessing the internet  continues to surge, leading to escalating network complexity and a strain on available wireless  radio bandwidth. This surge also raises concerns about the potential for interference in radio  frequencies, which can compromise the reliability and security of data transmission. However, Li 
Fi technology offers a promising solution by leveraging Visible Light Communication (VLC)  through light-emitting diodes (LED's) for data transmission. Li-Fi operates by using LED's as  transmitters and photo-diodes as receivers, utilizing light waves to carry data instead of traditional  radio frequencies. The use of light for data transmission not only enhances security but also  mitigates concerns about radio frequency interference. Moreover, the rapid advancements in LED  manufacturing have led to the development of highly efficient, durable, and long-lasting LEDs,  making them suitable for both private lighting and data transmission purposes. The effectiveness  of Li-Fi is further underscored by its ability to achieve data transmission rates of several gigabits  per second (GBPS), surpassing many existing wireless technologies. Consequently, the  implementation of Li-Fi technology holds immense potential for revolutionizing communication  systems, particularly in environments where security, speed, and reliability are paramount. The  design and implementation of Li-Fi audio transmission systems exemplify the innovative  applications of this cutting-edge technology, offering a glimpse into the future of wireless  communication. As research and development in Li-Fi continues to progress, the possibilities for  its integration into various industries and everyday applications are limitless, paving the way for a  more efficient and interconnected world.

**RESULTS** 
The transmission of audio signal was done through a Smartphone at the transmitter  end, providing the audio signal through the 3.5 mm jack. The 3.5mm audio jack and  the input audio from the phone is converted from digital to analog. A typical 3.5mm  audio jack has three output lines namely, right, left and the ground. The left and right  have the audio output signal, which is connected to the negative of the 9V battery.  The ground of the 3.5mm jack is given to the negative of the LED array connected  on a breadboard and the positive of the 9V array is given to the resistors in series  with the LED array. This circuit effectively modulates the intensity of the LED light,  which acts as carrier wave, according to the effective voltage difference. The  fluctuations occur at a high speed, invisible to the naked human eye. This variation  in the intensity of light, however, is captured on a solar panel that acts as a photo  detector. It captures all the variations and sends the received signal to the amplifier,  which amplifies the signal and gives the audio output through the speaker. The  sound intensity received from the speaker varies based on the distance of the solar  panel from the LED arrays. This shows that the information can be received from  the line of sight of the LED array. As the distance between the LED array and the  solar panel increases, the intensity of light reduces and the light becomes more  scattered thus, making it difficult for the solar panel to detect all the light rays being  emitted.
